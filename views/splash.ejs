            <p align="left" id="text">First Step<br/>The first step would be choosing a platform to build your website
                (like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap) or You could use a CMS (Content Management System) like WordPress, Joomla or
                Drupal.I would suggest you to use WordPress which is one of the most widely used CMS even by the biggest
                of firms. Once you have done this you could proceed through the next step.<br/><br/>Second Step<br/>The
                second step would be finding a domain name and a web hosting service.There are a huge bunch of firms
                which provides this but I would suggest you to use GoDaddy for finding your Domain and web hosting
                service. Godaddy provides you with a suitable domain name and is inexpensive.Donâ€™t forget to google
                coupon codes before buying a Domain Name on GoDaddy. It actually saved me a lot of bucks.<br/><br/>The
                Final Step<br/>The final step would be installing your wordpress site to your Domain Name. WordPress has
                an special option for One-Press Installation for the same. I would also suggest you to use some
                WordPress plugins which would make your website a better one.</p>

                Everyday I have practiced to take inspiration from every person I have met, tried to learn from them
                irrespective of their flaws. I have learnt to take in inspiration for the need of achieving my goals. I
                have tried to take in inspiration from the firm friend who handles situation with a still head, tried to
                take inspiration from the friend who talks wise, tried to take inspiration from the old aged fruit
                seller who sold her fruits with the same enthusiasm everyday, tried to take inspiration from my parents
                who have never stopped to shower their love, tried to take inspiration the friend who never missed a
                class and from the friend who never failed to miss a Shark Khan movie, tried to take inspiration from
                every possible person and thing. I have stilled under performed. I have aimed for a perfect score in
                Math paper , was 3 marks short, I have aimed for getting into the prestigious IITs, got into a IIIT,I
                have aimed to secure a foreign internship in an Institute I dreamt, landed an internship at Bangalore
                this summer, I have aimed to win a Table Tennis Tournament for my college but have been out of the semis
                twice . I have under performed but taking in motivation from every person and every little thing in life
                have made my life still content-full. I still remember the days I have under performed but I have learnt
                that taking in inspiration from every possible thing that would keep one going and strive for the last
                mile which kept me from underperforming would make oneâ€™s life better.<br/><br/>Taking in inspiration
                from everyone and every possible thing is the key which I am sure would help me reach that extra mile.

                our hostel, talking about how exciting the dates are gonna be and bid adieu. That night when we returned
                back to our respective hostels, I messaged her boasting how good I am at picking names and gave her a
                hint that it was the name of my favourite sitcom character.<br/><br/>3rd Feb<br/><br/>Like any other day
                we were walking around our hostel discussing random stuff. I asked her if she selected a name for me.
                She told that she has done it but wants me to reveal the name first. I told her the name was Rachel. I
                could see the excitement in her eyes imagining herself as Rachel (a character from the sitcom
                F.R.I.E.N.D.S). Incidentally she has picked the name Ross (a character from the sitcom F.R.I.E.N.D.S ).
                I was awestruck, we were already on the same page. We called this to be the zeroth day of our 40 day
                dating challenge. Both of us were equally excited for the following day. The same night I messaged her
                if she was ready for the dating challenge and the reply was a â€˜Hell Yeahâ€™. I spent the rest of the night
                thinking about the probable dating destinations. It was her first ever date and I wanted the date to be
                a memorable one for both of us. I felt that I could do anything for the smile on her face.<br/><br/>4th
                Feb<br/>We woke up all excited and went on for a walk around our hostel getting to know each other and
                revealing few untold secrets. We looked into the eyes of each other and enjoyed the moment under the
                innocuous blue clouds. We hopped into different areas of our locality, even a nearby temple. I planned
                for a lunch date and asked to get ready by 1pm. I told her that the destination would be a surprise. I
                went back to the hostel and finalized a dating destination for the day after immense google searches and
                phone calls. Selecting the place would be a key for the date and was an herculean task. I took a shower
                and hopped into my best clothes, tried using all the cosmetics my friend had and tried to look good
                which I conspicuously failed to. I grabbed my keys, got down the stairs and saw her waiting. I was
                awestruck and fell for her panache at the same moment. We drove and gossiped through out the way and
                finally reached the destination. It was an amazing restaurant which had a treehouse in it. I could see
                the excitement in her eyes when we were climbing the stairs which guided us to the treehouse, where we
                were about to have our lunch. We had some amazing time on the tree house 15 feet above the ground all
                excited, complimented by some amazing Italian dishes which we never had before. We left the place after
                clicking few pictures and headed towards a bowling alley where we had an amazing bowling experience,
                felt like we were in a different world. We drove back to our hostel after making memories which would
                never fade away. This was one of the most amazing dates I have ever had.Some memories never fade
                away.<br/><br/>PS - This was the first day of our 40 day dating challenge.</p>

            <p align="left" id="text">The smartest thing done by lazy people is that they doesn&#39;t do things , smart
                isn&#39;t it. They make their fellow beings to do their things and enjoy the coziness of their bed.<br/><br/>The
                day was hot and I was really lazy to switch on my fan which was few feet away from me.There was this
                friend of mine who lives next door , and is really intrigued by coding and he is always enthusiastic and
                forthright to fix bugs and enjoy the sight of a code which runs successfully. I pinged my friend saying
                that I had bugs in my code and I wanted it to be fixed as soon as possible. I grabbed my laptop and just
                removed a semicolon from some random line(yeah! the language was not Python) of some previously written
                code on my desktop. My friend just entered the room and asked for the problem with ease. I handed him
                over my lappy and he found the error in no time (although he only had to run the code and check for the
                error returned by the compiler :P ). While he was leaving my room I asked him to turn on my fan, which
                he did conspicuously. Problem solved.<br/><br/>PS- Believe it or not I was the one on the bed.</p>

            <p align="left" id="text">This happened during my second semester at a IIIT. The subject was Calculus.It was
                9:00 am and we were ready to get our question papers. As soon as I got my papers I went through it and
                came to a conclusion that it was even difficult score 5 marks in this 40 marks paper.I had no idea and
                ended up watching faces and was literally tensed watching all people seriously attempting their paper.
                Its generally a difficult thing to cheat over here.I saw my friend walking towards the washroom room
                from the window which I was sitting beside and walked briskly towards the washroom.I entered and was
                really excited to find people discussing.I thought I could collect few answers but found our Registrar
                coming out of one of the private room who signalled me to remain silent and was unnoticed by my poor
                friends.Our registrar caught those guys and told them he would reduce their marks to a single digit
                number.The situation shifts towards the mess.Found all the four friends who were caught were not really
                worried with huge smiles over their faces. As soon as I joined them I knew that none of us would
                actually reach the double digit mile stone. (Smiles all over in the scene).<br/>&quot;Registrar,we have
                reduced your work as we were confident of scoring single digit marks,now you have no chance of reducing
                them&quot; -these were the lines said by one of my friend.</p>
